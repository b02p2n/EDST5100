Summary of Information  
Course and Term:  EDST5100    Term 3
Title: Foundation 2 – Field of Educational Practice  
Weighting: 60%
Assessment type: Position Paper and Poster 
Group work: No
Assessment Description: 
Scenario – You are working in a new university as a researcher in Education. You have been asked by your supervisor to research and develop a poster that explains the importance of an educational specialisation to Education. This work will be part of showcase or expo of big ideas and issues in Education that is designed to attract students to enrol in a new post graduate program focussed on understanding the nature of Education in the contemporary context.
How to complete the assessment: 
Choose 1 specialisation from the topics listed in weeks 3-9 in the Course Outline. Research this topic using at least 10 peer reviewed journal articles, along with professional literature and policy documents.1. In your position paper, briefly introduce the specialisation and the basic tenets. (500 words)2. Argue a case for the significance of the nominated specialisation to Education. Consider how the specialisation is: a) represented in policy, institutional structures and educational settings including schools, adult learning programs, tertiary programs, and b) functions in a local and/or state, and/or national and/or global education contexts. (1500 words)3. Design a poster that summarises your research findings using no more than 1000 words, images, diagrams, and graphics to illustrate and explain your findings. (200-1000 words)
Acceptable use of Generative AI: 
Simple editing assistance 
For this assessment task, you may use standard editing and referencing software, but not generative AI. You are permitted to use the full capabilities of the standard software to answer the question (e.g. you may wish to specify particular software such as Microsoft Office suite, Grammarly, etc.).
